# File name prefix for versioned SQL migrations (default: V)

# The file name prefix for undo SQL migrations. (default: U)
# Undo SQL migrations are responsible for undoing the effects of the versioned migration with the same version.
# They have the following file name structure: prefixVERSIONseparatorDESCRIPTIONsuffix ,

# Flyway Pro and Flyway Enterprise only

# Comma-separated list of file name suffixes for SQL migrations. (default: .sql)
# SQL migrations have the following file name structure: prefixVERSIONseparatorDESCRIPTIONsuffix ,

# flyway.validateOnMigrate=

# Whether to automatically call clean or not when a validation error occurs. (default: false)
# This is exclusively intended as a convenience for development. Even tough we
# strongly recommend not to change migration scripts once they have been checked into SCM and run, this provides a
# way of dealing with this case in a smooth manner. The database will be wiped clean automatically, ensuring that
# the next migration will bring you back to the state checked into SCM.

# Whether to automatically call baseline when migrate is executed against a non-empty schema with no schema history table.
# This schema will then be initialized with the baselineVersion before executing the migrations.
# Only migrations above baselineVersion will then be applied.
# This is useful for initial Flyway production deployments on projects with an existing DB.
# Be careful when enabling this as it removes the safety net that ensures
# Flyway does not migrate the wrong database in case of a configuration mistake! (default: false)

# Allows migrations to be run "out of order" (default: false).
# If you already have versions 1 and 3 applied, and now a version 2 is found,
# it will be applied too instead of being ignored.

# (unknown to us) has also been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
# warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to deploy
# a newer version of the application even though it doesn't contain migrations included with an older one anymore.
# Note that if the most recently applied migration is removed, Flyway has no way to know it is missing and will
# mark it as future instead.

# (unknown to us) has already been applied. Instead of bombing out (fail fast) with an exception, a
# warning is logged and Flyway continues normally. This is useful for situations where one must be able to redeploy
